##### The most common variation of the COMT gene is the Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680) in which a single G/A base-pair substitution leads to a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitution at codon 158. This Met substitution reduces the activity of COMT enzyme to one-quarter of what is originally encoded by the Val allele. Thereby, Met carriers have higher extracellular DA level in the prefrontal cortex, a region that is vital for affective decision making, as suggested by both lesion and fMRI studies.[^1]
